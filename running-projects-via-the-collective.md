# Running projects via the collective

- We wanna run via the collective BV the projects that require more than 1 fikaworks member
- The invoicing and money flow will be: `customer` ->  `fikaworks BV` -> `members BV ( or external contractors)`
- There will be an contract between client and fikaworks BV and a different contract between the fikaworks BV and the external contractors

## Distributing projects
- Jobs will go first to the collective members and then will be shared with the broader slack community 

## Project Financials

- Fee for external contractors/fikaworks cummunity members: 10% (for the first 3 months)
- We can pay back the fee if the contractor/community member joins the collective as a full member (in 1 year)
- Incubating members will not pay a fee
- Minimum rate for executing a project: [confidential] euro
- Minimum asking rate [confidential] euro
- Exception for accepting lower rates to be discussed in the collective

## Dropping projects procedure
- Exit clause (from members/contarctors) should to match client contract
