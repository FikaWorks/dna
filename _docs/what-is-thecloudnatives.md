What is FikaWorks and why?
======================

**FikaWorks is a home for IT consultants who value:**

-   **Empathy** - First of all we work with people. We genuinely care about our customers.
-   **Community** - We like to hang out with people who share our values; we want to give back to the community
-   **Freedom** - We wanna choose how much we work, the projects we work on and the people we work with
-   **Continuous learning** - Passion for looking at what is next and how to apply it to existing problems
-   **Professionalism** - We value craftmanship and we avoid cutting corners

We believe these values lead to personal happiness as well as business success.

Basically, we're trying to find the magic balance between being an independent consultant (full freedom, no support), and being an employee (little freedom, lots of support).
