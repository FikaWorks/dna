What is this?
=============

This site is an [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) site
describing how theCloudNatives works and why.

This website is a fork of
[https://github.com/crispab/crisp-dna](https://github.com/crispab/crisp-dna)
we strongly believe on their ideas and principles so we made a copy and
adjusted it to our needs.

[theCloudNatives](https://thecloudnatives) is an independent collective of
cloud native consultants based in the Netherlands. 

- Consultants are 100% autonomous. None of the consultants are actually employed by {{ site.company_name }}
- We have no managers, or a CEO. Instead we rely on self-organization
- FikaWorks doesn't want to earn money from it's consultants. It is in FikaWorks main purpose is have a strong and diverse group of people.
- We target projects that require at least 2 members of the collective.
- Every project we take will benefit from the support and knowledge base of the entire collective.
- Almost everything is bottom-up, and [anyone can drive any decision](decisions.html).
- Consultants keep revenue and delighted customers are a side effect, not a goal. They don't hurt the brand or [our house](what-is-fikaworks.html), and work as much or as little as they want.
